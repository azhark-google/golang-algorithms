Algorithms and data structure implementations in golang
Data structures and algorithms are crucial for writing an effecient program in any programming languages. I have here tried to the mostly used data structures and algorithms in golang including and not limited to:
1. Hash Table implementation using linked list for hash collisions
2. Linked List implementation
3. Binary Search Tree implementation
4. Graph Traversal
5. Finding shortest path using Graphs
